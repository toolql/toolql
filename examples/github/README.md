# Sample tools for Github API

Provides a set of tools to enable an agent to answer questions about your Gihub repositories and activity.

## You could ask...

How many repositories do I have access to?

What repositories have I committed to this week?

etc...

In addition to query-based tools such as these, this toolkit includes a mutation to add a star to any project, including special handling for the `toolql` project to express our gratitude. Please consider giving us a star, thanks!
