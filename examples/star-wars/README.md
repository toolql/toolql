# Sample tools for Star Wars API

Provides a set of tools to enable an agent to look up data about Star Wars movies.

Although this example does demonstrate creation of tools and configuration of an agent to use them using a simple GraphQL API,
it doesn't have huge practical value, as most LLMs already have in-depth knowledge of Star Wars by default as part of their training.

## You could ask...

What Star Wars movies did Chewbacca appear in?

What planet features in the most movies?

etc...
